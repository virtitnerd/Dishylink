// The extension's cloud binding, service-worker side.
//
// The account features read starlink.com over the internet, not the LAN — a
// wholly separate concern from the historian (no dish, no poll loop, its own
// auth). The request logic is the shared, host-agnostic createCloudHandler; this
// wires it to the extension's session store and network, the way the dev proxy
// wires a file and Electron the keychain:
//
//   • session store — our OWN captured copy in chrome.storage, not the browser's
//     live jar. Connect reads the jar once and hands the handler that copy;
//     disconnect deletes our copy and leaves the browser's starlink.com login
//     untouched. This mirrors every other host: connected means we hold a copy.
//   • token — the short-lived Access.V1 rotates, and a service worker cannot read
//     Set-Cookie to capture the refresh (Node can, which is how the file host
//     does it). So the fresh token is read back from the jar the refresh call
//     populates and merged over our stored session; our stored copy stays the
//     owned session, so disconnect still severs only what is ours.
//   • network — the Cookie header is appended to the worker's fetches via a
//     declarativeNetRequest rule; a cross-site service-worker fetch has cookies
//     withheld by SameSite, so credentials alone are not enough.
