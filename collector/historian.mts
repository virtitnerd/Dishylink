// Always-on energy historian + HTTP API.
//
// Polls the dish's history ring buffer directly (reusing the frontend's
// grpc-web transport and decoder so the two never drift), folds new per-second
// power readings into per-minute energy buckets, and persists completed minutes
// to an NDJSON log. Serves day/week/month energy totals over /api/energy.
//
// Energy is integrated ONLY over minutes actually sampled — historian downtime
// (sleep, restart, Wi-Fi drop) shows up as reduced coverage, never as invented
// kWh. Short gaps (≤15 min) are backfilled losslessly from the ring buffer on
// the next poll.
//
// Run: npm run historian   (foreground; see collector/README for always-on setup)
