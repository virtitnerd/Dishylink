// Lint rules for every tree in the repo: the browser app, the shared core, the
// Electron host, the historian, the extension, the cloud handler, and the dev
// tooling. A tree with no block here is silently unlinted, so a new one needs a
// `files` entry added below — matching the tsconfig it is checked by.
//
// Type-aware linting is deliberately off. `tsc -b` runs the app, host and
// historian projects and `npm run typecheck:extension` the extension, and those
// are the authority on types; turning on typescript-eslint's type-checked presets
// would parse the whole program a second time for rules that largely restate what
// strict TypeScript already refuses. What is left here is what the compiler cannot
// see: unused code, React's hook rules, and the handful of correctness traps below.
