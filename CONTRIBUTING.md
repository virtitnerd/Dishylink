# Contributing to Dishylink

Thanks for taking an interest. Dishylink talks to real Starlink hardware, so a
couple of the rules below are about not breaking someone's internet rather than
about code style — please read the hardware section before touching anything
that polls the dish or router.

## Before you start

Most of the app can be worked on from anywhere, but anything that reads live
telemetry needs you to be **on the Starlink network itself**. The dish answers on
`192.168.100.1` and the router on `192.168.1.1`; neither is reachable from
outside the LAN, and there is no public test fixture that behaves like real
hardware under load.

If you can't get on a Starlink network, good areas to help with are the charts,
the recorded-history views, tests, and documentation — all of which run against
recorded or synthetic data.

## Hardware safety

The router is a small embedded device and has rebooted under ordinary polling
load. Two rules follow from that:

- **Never call the router's `get_ping` (field 1009), at any cadence.** It was
  trialled at 2s, 5s and 30s; each trial was followed within ~15 minutes by a
  router watchdog reboot that took the network down. Router ping success is
  already available from `get_status`'s `popPingDropRate5m`, which rides a reply
  the app is fetching anyway.
- **Don't add a new poll against the dish or router.** Reuse a reply that is
  already being fetched — `routerStatusFeed` in the browser, or the existing
  status poll in the recorder. If you genuinely need a new one, raise an issue
  first so it can be discussed before anyone's link goes down. This applies
  equally to `backend/starlink_client.py`, which polls the hardware
  independently of the TS code above — it is not exempt just because it's a
  separate implementation.

Custom DNS, bypass mode and content filtering are deliberately not exposed: a
bad write there can take the WiFi down until a physical reset.

## Running it

```bash
npm install

npm run dev             # web dev harness — requires being on the Starlink LAN
npm run dev:electron    # desktop app (macOS, Windows)
npm run dev:extension   # browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
cd backend && ./start.sh # standalone server (Python/FastAPI), see backend/README.md
```

The desktop app, the extension, and the standalone server are independent:
they don't share a runtime, and each polls and records on its own. (The web
dev harness is the exception — it proxies `/api/*` to the standalone server
rather than duplicating that logic, so `backend/server.py` needs to be running
for `npm run dev` to show real data.) A change to shared code under `src/`
affects the desktop app, extension, and dev harness; a change under `backend/`
needs a server restart to take effect and doesn't touch the other three at all.

## Checks

CI runs on every push and pull request, and must be green before a PR is merged:

```bash
npm run typecheck            # tsc -b
npm run lint                 # eslint, warnings fail the build
npm test                     # vitest
npm run format               # prettier, fixes the tree in place
npm run typecheck:extension  # extension-specific types
```

Formatting is only enforced on files a change touches, so you won't be asked to
reformat code you didn't write.

Tests run in Node except for a few extension files that need real IndexedDB;
those run in headless Chromium via Playwright. `npx playwright install chromium`
once if you haven't got it.

## Pull requests

- Branch off `master`, one topic per PR.
- **Label the PR** `enhancement`, `bug` or `documentation`. Release notes are
  generated from these labels, so an unlabelled PR lands under "Other Changes".
- Describe what you changed and, for anything touching the dish or router, how
  you verified it against real hardware.

## Releasing

For maintainers:

```bash
npm version minor        # bumps package.json, commits, and tags
git push --follow-tags
```

Pushing a `v*` tag builds macOS, Windows and the extension archives, and creates
a **draft** release. Nothing reaches users until the draft is published on
GitHub — installed apps ignore drafts, so that click is the actual rollout.

The tag must match `package.json`'s version; CI fails fast if it doesn't, which
is why `npm version` is the right way to bump rather than editing by hand.

## Reporting problems

Open an issue with your dish and router firmware versions, the platform you're
on, and the output of **Copy debug data** from the settings panel where it's
relevant — it bundles diagnostics, status and config as JSON.

If you believe you've found a security issue, please report it privately through
the repository's security tab rather than opening a public issue.

## Thank you

However you're helping — a new feature, a bug fix, better docs, or just a typo
in this file — it's appreciated. Dishylink is better for having more eyes on it,
and every improvement lands with someone squinting at a bad link at 2am.

Happy contributing.
