An open-source Starlink desktop app for macOS, Windows and browsers to monitor
the performance and health of your Starlink.

It reads your dish and router directly over your local network, so it keeps
working during an outage — which is exactly when you want to see what happened.
No account, no cloud, no telemetry: everything it records is written to your own
machine and stays there. Connecting a Starlink account is optional. It adds
your plan and billing figures and enables supported router controls such as
pausing connected devices. Your session remains stored locally and is sent
only to Starlink.

Not sure which to pick? On Windows, take Universal. On macOS, take `arm64` for
Apple silicon (M1 and later) or `x64` for Intel.

## Features

### What it shows

- **Stat tiles**: live downlink and uplink, pop-ping latency, power draw in watts,
  60-second ping-success rate and sky-obstruction fraction. Each carries a
  sparkline and opens into a detail panel.
- **Throughput chart**: download and upload across 15m, 1h and 6h windows on the
  dashboard, or by day, week and month from recorded history rather than only what
  the current tab has seen.
- **Latency chart**: bucketed by _max_, so spikes survive downsampling instead of
  averaging away. Outages are drawn as red bands.
- **Energy and power chart**: what the dish actually draws over time, with kWh
  totals by day, week and month, and honest gaps wherever recording stopped.
- **Sky obstruction map**: the dish's 123×123 SNR grid drawn as a polar sky dome,
  with obstructed cells escalating through a status palette.
- **Obstruction time-lapse**: scrub back through hourly snapshots of the sky
  survey, with LIVE as the last stop.
- **Sky view**: a full-viewport scene of the dome, your dish, and the satellite
  constellation passing overhead. Click any satellite for its pass details.
- **Alignment dials**: rotation and tilt against the desired azimuth and elevation
  band, ported from the dish's own web app.
- **Data usage**: self-measured download and upload volume by day, week and month,
  plus **per-device usage** for the billing month taken from the router's own
  per-client counters. Name your devices and see vendor, device type and last-seen
  times.
- **Network**: router radio temperatures, the client list, per-client throughput
  and the router's own event log.
- **Event logs**: outages, thermal events, and a terminal panel covering firmware,
  GPS, alignment, mesh routers and alerts.
- **Speed test and alerts**: on-demand speed tests, alerts graded by severity with
  an in-app bell, and light, dark or system instrument themes.
- **Cloud account tab** (optional, opt-in): your Starlink plan, billing cycles and
  authoritative monthly data usage, plus the authenticated controls your router
  supports.

### What it controls

Monitoring is only half of it. Most settings write to the dish or router over
the same LAN API; controls that current firmware rejects locally are identified
below as requiring an optional Starlink account connection:

- **Snow melt**: automatic, always on, or off.
- **Sleep schedule**: power the dish down for a set number of hours each day.
- **Software updates**: pick the reboot window, or defer updates for 3 days.
- **Maintenance**: reboot the dish, reset the learned obstruction map, and
  stow/unstow motorized kits.
- **Router**: SSIDs and their bands, mesh node trust, firmware and country, and
  a router reboot.
- **Router address and subnet**: point Dishylink at a router that isn't on the
  default address, and change the address range the router hands out. Changing the
  subnet needs a connected account.
- **Custom DNS**: point the router at your own resolvers.
- **Bypass mode**: put the router into bridge mode for your own networking gear.
- **Connected devices**: pause or unpause another device while it is connected.
  Available in the desktop app and web development harness, this control requires
  an optional Starlink account sign-in: Dishylink reads the router configuration
  locally, prepares the smallest accepted client update on the trusted host, and
  sends it only to Starlink's authenticated device endpoint. The device running
  Dishylink cannot pause itself, which is what **Your device on this network** in
  app settings pins down. The browser extension does not expose this control
  because ordinary desktop extensions cannot reliably read the host computer's LAN
  IP or MAC address. Although the extension can send the update, it cannot prove
  which router client is itself and therefore cannot safely prevent self-pausing.
- **Copy debug data**: diagnostics + status + config as JSON, for bug reports.

Content filtering is deliberately _not_ exposed: a bad write there can take the
WiFi down until a physical reset.

### Network rules

Meter any device on your network and pause it automatically when it goes over.

- **Three kinds of limit**: a data allowance, a schedule that pauses by the clock,
  or a countdown that runs for a set stretch of time.
- **One device or a group**: meter a device on its own, or group several together.
  A group can either pool its allowance, so members spend from one shared budget
  and run out together, or give each member the full allowance to spend
  independently.
- **One list for everything**: every rule on the network appears in one place,
  whether you wrote it there or from a device's own card, each showing how much of
  its limit is left.
- Rules use the same account-connected pausing described above, including the
  protection that stops Dishylink pausing the device it is running on.

## Four ways to run it

Dishylink ships as four independent products from one codebase — pick
whichever fits:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev              # web dev harness on localhost:5173 — requires being on the Starlink LAN
npm run dev:electron     # desktop app on Mac and Linux
npm run dev:electron:win # desktop app on Windows
npm run dev:extension    # browser extension, loaded unpacked from .output/ (WXT)
cd backend && ./start.sh # standalone server / Docker — headless, single port
```

Windows needs `dev:electron:win` rather than `dev:electron`: it sets the
environment variable through `cross-env` and skips the icon generation step,
neither of which works from a Windows shell.

The desktop app, the extension, and the standalone server each poll the
dish/router directly and record their own history independently — none of
them talk to each other. The web dev harness is the one exception: it proxies
`/api/*` to the standalone server (`backend/server.py`, default port `8787`)
rather than reimplementing a second copy of that logic for local development,
so `backend/server.py` needs to already be running for `npm run dev` to show
real data. See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for what the standalone
server is and why it's a separate implementation from the other three, not a
shared library underneath them. Packaging:

```bash
npm run pack:mac        # signed Mac build
npm run pack:win        # Windows build
npm run build:extension # Chromium extension bundle
npm run build:extension:firefox
npm run build:extension:edge
docker build -t dishylink .   # standalone server, single port, see Dockerfile
```

Useful while working on it:

```bash
npm run historian       # standalone energy collector, serving /api/energy
npm run test:watch      # vitest in watch mode
npm run lint:fix        # eslint with --fix
```

A fresh desktop build opens with no history by design: it fills up as it runs.

### Desktop app (Mac, Windows)

- Lives in the tray / menu bar and **keeps recording after its window is
  closed**; it quits only from the tray's Quit.
- **Live throughput readout** — ↓/↑ rates in the macOS menu bar, or a draggable
  always-on-top pill on Windows. Whichever surface, the open window feeds it
  when there is one and the recorder takes over when there isn't, so the dish is
  never polled twice.
- **Start at Login**, launching hidden, so collection covers the outages that
  happen while nobody is looking.
- Native OS notifications for alerts when the window isn't in front, throttled
  so a flapping link can't spam.
- Auto-updates, and remembers its window position across runs and displays.

### Browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

Install it from the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dishylink/pljgamnkfokhbchiiommnblkjffffnna)
or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/dishylink/).

- The toolbar icon opens the dashboard as a chromeless window (default) or an
  ordinary tab — never a cramped toolbar popup.
- **Toolbar badge** — the number of alerts firing right now, tinted by the worst
  one's severity, so it reads the same outside the app as the bell does inside.
- **Recording** — its own history store in IndexedDB, filled by a 30s
  `chrome.alarms` tick that survives service-worker teardown, with honest
  coverage gaps for stretches when the browser was closed.
- Chrome 144+ — below that a Local Network Access bug makes the worker silently
  collect nothing.

### Server (Docker, headless)

A Python/FastAPI backend (`backend/`) that polls the dish and router itself,
records its own local history, and serves `/api/*`, `/cloud/*`,
`/celestrak/*`, and the built frontend from one process on one port —
`8787` by default. Meant for a NAS, homelab box, or anywhere you want
Dishylink running without a desktop app or browser open, and for the eventual
option of pointing the desktop app or extension at a shared instance instead
of each polling the hardware on its own. See
[backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for configuration and the full route
list.

```bash
docker build -t dishylink .
docker run -p 8787:8787 dishylink
```

Dev workflow:

```bash
npm test                # vitest
npm run typecheck       # tsc -b
npm run lint            # eslint
```

Diagnostics:

```bash
node scripts/debug-decode.mjs <captured-body.bin>   # decode a captured response
node scripts/debug-browser.mjs                      # probe fetch path in headless Chrome
```

## How it talks to the dish and router

The dish serves its API at `192.168.100.1` on two ports; the router answers
a matching API on its own LAN address:

| Port | Protocol                | Notes                               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 9200 | native gRPC (HTTP/2)    | used by `grpcurl`, has reflection   |
| 9201 | **grpc-web** (HTTP/1.1) | what this app uses from the browser |

Two quirks discovered while building (both handled by the Vite proxy in dev,
and by the host's own transport in Electron/the extension):

1. **CORS allowlist** — port 9201 only answers CORS preflights for the dish's
   own origin, so a third-party web page cannot call it cross-origin.
2. **Referer guard** — requests carrying an unrecognized `Referer` header get
   an empty 200 back; the transport strips `Referer`/`Origin` before forwarding.

Protobuf schema is **not guessed**: `schema/dish.protoset` was dumped from the
dish's own gRPC reflection service and is decoded at runtime with
`@bufbuild/protobuf` (`core/dishClient.ts`). To refresh the schema after a
firmware update:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -protoset-out schema/dish.protoset \
  192.168.100.1:9200 describe SpaceX.API.Device.Device
cp schema/dish.protoset public/dish.protoset
```

The dish's history ring buffer (900 samples @ 1 Hz) is unrolled via its
absolute sample counter (`core/telemetry.ts`); note it reports `outages[]`
timestamps in the **GPS epoch** while `eventLog` uses Unix — the converter
accounts for the 18 leap seconds. See `LOCAL-API.md` for the full set of
measured behaviours, quirks, and dead-end fields on this firmware.

The standalone server (`backend/starlink_client.py`) talks to the same two
APIs independently rather than sharing this code — being a real process and
not a browser, it calls the dish's native gRPC port (9200) directly instead
of going through the grpc-web port, and pulls its own copy of the schema from
the dish's reflection service at startup instead of the vendored protoset.

## Recorded history

The dish and router only hold a few minutes to a few hours locally. An
always-on **history recorder** (the "historian") polls continuously and writes
append-only local records so day/week/month views have real data behind
them — never anything invented across a gap; every range reports what
fraction of it was actually sampled. Desktop and the extension use
`collector/historian.mts` (see `collector/README.md`); the standalone server
uses its own `backend/historian.py`, writing the same style of append-only
local records independently rather than depending on the Node service.

Everything above is local-only by design: your telemetry, your history, your
storage, never transmitted.
